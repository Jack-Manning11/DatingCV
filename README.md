# Dating CV
below is a devlog for the first DatingCV prototype

# Dependencies
- For the router system I am using wouter as I already know it works and is functional with Cargo's deployment service (npm i wouter)
- For styling I am utilizing Styled Components to be able to make clear declarations for individual styled components (npm i styled-components)

# Timeline

## June - Initial Setup
- Installed wouter to set up a base router system that is adaptable in case future pages need to be added 
- Installed styled components and laid the groundwork for base styling
- Initialized a new repository to keep track of all progress
